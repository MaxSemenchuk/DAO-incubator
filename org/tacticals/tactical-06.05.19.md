## Adam/ Resort the order of discussion points

Meeting format: names indicate who will lead that section of the discussion. At 10 minutes to the end of the call, we'll skip from wherever we are to the asterisked agenda item\*\* for a lightning round

### Adam / Add announcements and discussion points

that are not listed, and rearrange the order of topics in case anyone is worried about an important topic getting missed because it's too low in the agenda

## Discussion

### Theo / EC Grant

### Pedro  / Roles, their descriptions and how they get assigned

What gaps exist in the current roles?  Can we establish a general process for filling gaps once they're identified?

### Adam / Circles 

Some circles don't have a leader, so it's hard to track who's responsible for what.

More importantly, many circles are still not functional.  DAOincubator members are currently voting on an [incubation procedure](https://www.loomio.org/d/XWlsrdyG/incubation-procedure-vote) that calls for circles to collaborate directly with pre-DAOs, which, whether it passes or not, goes to show that it's time for all circles to take shape.  This was supposed to happen organically, and it did in circles, but in others it didn't.  While most of the progress in circle's should be internally driven, it's worth considering a concerted effort to whip the lagging circles into shape \(including the one I lead.\)

I'm throwing it open to the group to discuss what this intervention looks like, but in my opinion, "taking shape" entails, at a minimum, identifying a leader as well as defining the circle's mandate.  

Now or soon, each circle must also define something resembling operating procedures: How does the circle manage communications with non-circle, non-WG entities?  How does it manage comms _with_ other circles and the WG? Are regular meetings essential to the circle's proper functioning?  And if not, what should be the procedure for identifying and attending to responsibilities within the circle?

### Pedro / Others Grants and funding sources

We're missing out on a good number of grant/microgrant opportunities -- not only organizational grants but also personal, artistic, etc. We've already assessed that legal and funding are the things needed most urgently at the moment.  

Also, we've ID'd funding as a priority, so it would seem that we need a funding circle.

### Adam / The website: how are we going to knock this out?

The site is a good case study of a tangible deliverable that we're struggling to deliver.  How can we do better, both here and in other goals we've set for ourselves?  Is the problem a lack of role definition?  A lack of engagement?

### Pedro / Cem's idea: a ledger for accounting the work we've been doing \(to eventually get paid for work we've done, and to keep track of what's going on\)

The trello was a great step forward, but we can dogfood something more advanced



## Announcement

### Adam / Vote on adopting Tuna's incubation procedure outline

There are details that remain to be filled in, of course,
